Hi! Here is a link to the dataset I am using <- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset

The Diabetes prediction dataset that I am currently using consists of a patient's medical and demographic information as well as their diabetes 
status. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood sugar 
level are among the characteristics of the data.

I created this repository to learn more about how data is researched and collected, as well as gain skills in data science and R.
